# How to rebuild the Web Mapping Components bundled library:

To rebuild the Web-Mapping-Components library, perform the following steps in the `web-mapping-components` directory (Note: npm is required);
1. `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. `npm run build` to build the Web-Mapping-Coponents Library
3. If the build process is successful, you will find a bundled version of your build in the `web-mapping-components/dist/` directory which will include copies of the `web-mapping-components.js` and `web-mapping-components.css` files.
